### **Enhanced Technical Implementation**

**Business Scoring Algorithm:**
```python
def calculate_business_score():
    # Weighted scoring (total = 100%)
    profitability_score = profit_margin × sale_velocity  # 35%
    demand_potential = location_fit × population × holidays × venues  # 30% 
    risk_adjustment = perishability × infrastructure_match  # 20%
    infrastructure_fit = storage_compatibility  # 10%
    customer_benefit = problem_solving_value  # 5%
```

**Real Financial Projections:**
- Monthly revenue estimates based on actual sale velocity
- Profit calculations using real Ghana market prices
